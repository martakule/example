      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>No one likes delivering or receiving bad news, and you might try to avoid being the one that has to give the negative message, but knowing the best way to deliver negative messages is an essential part of your business communication skill set.  Whether you are communicating with customers, investors, or employees, you need to make sure you are maintaining goodwill toward the receiver despite the nature of the news you are delivering. It’s not just about protecting yourself and your company from legal liabilities, either. You want to put the company’s best foot forward by being honest and accountable for your actions, and sensitive to the receiver of the bad news. This activity is designed to help you test your skills in delivering unfavourable news. </p>
      <p>Take on the role of an eager young entrepreneur and navigate your way through the tough situations that inevitably arise in the business world. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Your Role</h2>
      <p>You are a young entrepreneur starting up a business venture called Unstoppable Adventure Tours, a company based in Vancouver that provides tours and group adventures for people with disabilities. During your first year, everything has gone according to your business plan, and you’ve successfully completed each of the three tours you currently offer at least twice. You’ve got a great partner, Taylor, whom you’ve known since high school, and you’ve decided you can afford to hire a marketing coordinator to help spread the word about Unstoppable: Adventure Tours for Everyone. There are also three other employees who help lead the tours. Now, with the growing popularity of your company, you’re planning on expanding to include two more tours, starting out from Toronto, where Taylor lives. You’re excited about the prospect of expansion and hope things will go as well in Toronto as they have in Vancouver.</p>

      <h2>Scenario 1: Refusing a Request for Information or Declining an Invitation</h2>      
      <p>Just before the launch of your two new tours, you receive a letter from a local charity for amputee children in Vancouver inviting you to come to their annual awards ceremony and charity dinner and give a speech. However, you will be in Toronto during the ceremony to launch your new tours and must inform the charity, which has done a great deal of free advertising for you and provided you with a large share of your customers, that you will be unable to attend.</p>
      <p>Look at the two letters below. Which letter do you send?</p>

      <input id="00" type="radio" name="q0" value="option1" data-score="correct"><label for="00">Option 1</label>
      <input id="01" type="radio" name="q0" value="option2" data-score="wrong"><label for="01">Option 2</label>

      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option1">Well done! You opened neutrally, established a logical basis for your refusal, offered an alternative, and concluded with good wishes. Mr. Gibson graciously accepts your prize offer and expresses congratulations in launching your two new tours in Toronto.</p>
      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option2">Mr. Gibson doesn’t reply to your letter. He felt a little put off as soon as he saw in the opening of your letter that you would not be able to attend, and you only partially explained why you refused his offer. Your conciliatory alternative did not seem very sincere, and your closing didn’t include any forward-looking remark, so he didn’t feel the need to keep up any sort of connection with you or with Unstoppable Adventure Tours. As a result, you have lost his endorsement and a significant number of potential clients.</p>

          <h3>Option 1</h3>
            <p>Dear Mr. Gibson,</p> 

            <p>The Sunny Days Charity for amputee children in Vancouver is an outstanding organization that has brought so much happiness to the parents and children of our community. Unstoppable Adventure Tours is a grateful supporter of your charity, and I am honoured by your invitation to speak at your annual awards ceremony and charity dinner. </p>

            <p>As you may know, Unstoppable is about to launch two new tours that will be based out of Toronto. This launch has been many months in planning, and we are excited to able to provide further opportunities for adventure travel to people with disabilities, such as the children your charity supports. Unfortunately, the date of our launch coincides with the date of your annual awards ceremony and dinner, and as such, I am unable to attend. However, our company would be honoured to be a part of this exciting event and would like to offer an all-expense paid trip for a child and guardian on the tour of their choosing as a prize for one of your awards. I will be happy to send out the details and anything else you might need if you choose to accept. </p>

            <p>I wish you every success at your charity dinner and look forward to offering a lucky award winner the adventure of a lifetime. 

            <p>Best, </p>

          <p>Thank you very much for the kind invitation to speak at your annual awards ceremony and charity dinner. I have great respect for your organization and the work you do, and I am sorry to say that I will miss what is sure to be such an outstanding event.</p> 

          <p>Unfortunately, I already have an engagement on the same day as your awards dinner, and it is too late notice for me to change my schedule. However, I hope you will accept a prize offering of a free trip for a child and guardian on any one of our tours.</p> 

          <p>As I’ve already mentioned, I admire the work you’ve done and wish you every success with the charity dinner.</p>

      <h2>Scenario 2: Refusing a Claim</h2>
      <p>You’ve received a letter from a customer who took part in one of your tours a month ago. The customer complained about the theft of her expensive camera during one of the overnight stays at a cabin resort while visiting Chilliwack Lake. She has asked that you refund the price of the camera. However, the customer signed a waiver saying that she, and not Unstoppable Adventures, was responsible for the loss of any articles during the length of the trip.</p>
      <p>Look at the two letters below. Which letter do you send?</p>
      
      <input id="02" type="radio" name="q1" value="option1" data-score="wrong"><label for="02">Option 1</label>
      <input id="03" type="radio" name="q1" value="option2" data-score="correct"><label for="03">Option 2</label>

      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option1">Unfortunately, Ms. Pacey was not reconciled by your letter. She felt that you were blaming her for the loss of the camera when she read phrases such as, "you lost your camera," and, "the waiver you signed." She does not take advantage of the coupon you enclosed and writes a poor review of your tour on her blog.</p>
      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option2">Excellent! Your neutral language, full explanation, and offer of an alternative were well-received by Ms. Pacey. You were even able to get a hold of the lost camera from the hotel and return it to a thankful Ms. Pacey, who came back for another tour and brought three of her friends along with her.</p>

However, I have taken the liberty of contacting the manager of the hotel where you were staying at during the tour with a description of the camera, and if it is found it will be returned to you. I would also like to offer you the enclosed coupon for 30% off of your next tour with us. </p>

          <p>We value your business and look forward to providing you with more safe and fun adventure experiences. </p>

      <h2>Scenario 3: Turning Down Job Applicants</h2>
      <p>You’ve gone through several rounds of interviews and narrowed down your choice for marketing coordinator down to two candidates. In the end, you’ve decided to go with the candidate that has greater experience in marketing, and must inform the other candidate that he has not received the job.</p>
      <p>Look at the two letters below. Which letter do you send?</p>

      <input id="04" type="radio" name="q2" value="option1" data-score="wrong"><label for="04">Option 1</label>
      <input id="05" type="radio" name="q2" value="option2" data-score="correct"><label for="05">Option 2</label>

      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option1">Mr. Zerafa was disappointed that he did not get the position as marketing coordinator. Further, he was affronted by the direct refusal, and did not bother to read the rest of the letter. He felt discouraged and a lack of confidence when he went in for his next interview.</p>
      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option2">Well done! While Mr. Zerafa was disappointed that he did not get the position, your opening softened the blow, and the rest of the letter reassured him that the decision was not based on a lack of qualifications on his part. He went in to his next interview with confidence and was offered a position at that company.</p>

      <h2>Scenario 4: Announcing Bad News to Customers</h2>
      <p>A large storm has caused severe damage in Whistler, where one of your adventure tours is based. You have no choice but to cancel the trip for the time being, and must now inform the 21 customers who have signed and paid for the trip.</p>
      <p>Look at the two letters below. Which letter do you send?</p>

      <input id="06" type="radio" name="q3" value="option1" data-score="correct"><label for="06">Option 1</label>
      <input id="07" type="radio" name="q3" value="option2" data-score="wrong"><label for="07">Option 2</label>

      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option1">Great job! In your letter, you opened with a good buffer, provided a solid, reasonable explanation, stated the bad news in a dependent clause, and closed with a final reminder of the alternatives in a reader-centred phrase. Most of your customers chose another tour option and you were able to minimize the number of refunds you had to issue.</p>
      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option2">Your letter opened with a good buffer, provided a solid, reasonable explanation, and stated the bad news in a dependent clause. However, your apology in the last sentence was unnecessary. While you may have wanted to show sympathy for the inconvenience caused by the storm, the situation was beyond your company’s control, and an explanation on its own would have served better than the apology. Because of the apology, your customers felt they could lay the blame in the company, rather than the weather, and were less inclined to opt for one of the other tours, asking for a refund instead.</p>

      <h2>Scenario 5: Announcing Bad News to a Well-known Employee</h2>
      <p>After crunching your numbers, you’ve realized the storm in Whistler, and the subsequent refunds you had to issue, has created a bigger setback than you originally thought. Recently, your partner Taylor has asked about the feasibility of creating another tour based out of Toronto, after the successful first run of the two trips you launched a few months ago. You have to write to him and tell him that you don’t think this will be possible at this time.</p>
      <p>Look at the two letters below. Which letter do you send?</p>

      <input id="08" type="radio" name="q45" value="option1" data-score="wrong"><label for="08">Option 1</label>
      <input id="09" type="radio" name="q45" value="option2" data-score="correct"><label for="09">Option 2</label>

      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option1">Taylor is your business partner and friend. A direct message would have been more effective than the indirect message you chose. Taylor knows you appreciate this work, and the opening not only made him expect a positive rather than a negative response, and in retrospect seemed insincere. He was a little offended and your next meeting was fraught with tension.</p>
      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option2">Fantastic! Taylor is your business partner and friend. As such, a direct message is more effective at breaking the bad news than an indirect message. You quickly delivered the negative message, explained why, and moved on. Taylor was disappointed, but understood the situation, and the two of you were able to plan a budget at your next meeting that would allow for the organization of a new tour in the future.</p>

      <div class="emailContainer">
        <div class="email">
          <h3>Option 1</h3>
          <p>Dear Taylor,</p>

          <p>Thanks for your latest message. Our two new Toronto tours had a successful first run, and they were even able to exceed our expected profits. I was thrilled by the results and I know we owe a huge part of that success to your hard work.</p>

          <p>Organizing another tour option starting from the Toronto area sounds like a great idea, and the suggestions you’ve made are excellent. Unfortunately, we are unable to budget for a new tour at this time. As you aware, the storm in Whistler and subsequent cancellation of the tour has created a larger setback than either of us anticipated. I will send you the report on the outcome of the tour cancellation by the end of the week.</p> 

          <p>In the meantime, I will look into how much of a budget we would need to be able to expand and include the new adventure tour you’ve suggested for considering in the future. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call me.</p>

          <p>As you know, the storm in Whistler and subsequent cancellation of the tour has created a larger setback than either of us anticipated.

Now you must inform them that they will not be receiving a bonus.</p>
      <p>Look at the two letters below. Which letter do you send?</p>

      <input id="010" type="radio" name="q5" value="option1" data-score="wrong"><label for="010">Option 1</label>
      <input id="011" type="radio" name="q5" value="option2" data-score="correct"><label for="011">Option 2</label>

      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option1">Your employees weren’t thrilled by the news. They understood that the damage in Whistler caused financial setbacks to the company, but they would have felt more reassured if you had included a paragraph that would help motivate employees to accept the loss of an expected bonus. The other letter had a paragraph explaining that how the company’s money was used would benefit employees in the long run.</p>
      <p class="answer question backgroundTexture" data-text="option2">Your employees weren’t thrilled by the news, but your explanation did leave them feeling invested in the company and willing to stick it out to see better times.</p>

          <h3>Option 1</h3> 
          <p>Dear Employees,</p> 

          <p>Unstoppable Adventure tours has had a fantastic first year in business, and we owe a great deal of our success to your hard work. We’ve received wonderful feedback from our adventurers about the quality of care and attention they received from their tour guides during their trips. We’ve also built a name for ourselves as a company that opens up opportunities for new experiences for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>Although we’ve been successful overall, we have met with some challenges along the way. The severe storm in Whistler and the damage it caused led to unexpected expenses for the company. As such, we are unable to offer our employees a bonus for this past quarter. We felt that this decision was better than cutting costs in other areas of the business by cancelling tours or terminating employees. Rest assured that this setback is temporary and we plan on having a regular bonus payout in the next quarter.</p>

          <p>If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.</p>

In time, this company growth will allow us to offer better benefits and more competitive salaries.</p>
